# Team Split - 
## Backend/Terminal UI Tasks | Stage 1 - Multithreading, no moving NPCs/Obstacles
- Tasks Class, Task Assigner
- Integration of tasks and moving EVs in the terminal map that works with prakrititz frontend.
- Note: Prakrititz implemented moving EVs in frontend consistent with the backend using startX, startY and endX, endY
- While writing the code, make sure it can support multithreading in future or implement multithreading also.

## Frontend/SpringBoot/Phaser.js | Stage 1 only
- Sync changes with the backend using springboot and phaser.js
- Add UI for assigning tasks to the EVs through UI in phaser.js or even html/css/js is fine
- **Members - Prakrititz Borah, satyam, ansh**
